# Simple_Translator
This Python script is a simple speech translator that allows you to translate spoken language into Urdu [ language can be adjusted  accordingly]. It utilizes various libraries to record audio input, transcribe it into text, translate it into Urdu, and then convert it back into speech. This can be useful for language translation applications or individuals needing translation assistance.

--To translate the text, the script uses the ".translate" function, which takes three parameters: text, source, and destination. In this case, the source language was English, which is the default value, so only the text and destination parameters were used.

## Dependencies
---speech_recognition: Used for recording audio and transcribing it into text.
---googletrans: Utilized for translating the transcribed text into Urdu.
